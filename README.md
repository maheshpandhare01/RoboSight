# RoboSight
Robosight is a Arduino based Project. I used some Hardware parts like Arduino Uno and L293D Motor Controller for store code and perform action. Arduino Software is used to upload data into Hardware. Android App Inventor is used to Create an Android app which sends Device's sensors data to Processing Software. Then Connect both Devices.
