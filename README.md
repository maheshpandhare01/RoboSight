# RoboSight
Robosight is a Arduino based Project. I used some Hardware parts like Arduino Uno and L293D Motor Controller for store code and perform action. Arduino Software is used to upload data into Hardware. Android App Inventor is used to Create an Android app which sends Device's sensors data to Processing Software. Then Connect both Devices.
Robo-Sight Embedded Systems Arduino Uno, C Programmed an Arduino
Uno microcontroller in C to control robot navigation. Implemented logic for
Bluetooth communication, motor control (using the L293D motor controller), and
sensor integration (if applicable)
Hardware Integration: Designed and assembled the physical robot car, integrating
sensors, motors, and esntial components with the Arduino Uno.
Bluetooth Communication: Enabled wireless control or data transfer (if applicable)
using the Bluetooth module, allowing for external interaction or feedback
